                <h1 class="contact-item-1">Please read the following information before contacting us:</h1>
                <p class="contact-item-2">If you're interested in welcoming one of our kittens into your home, we'd love to hear from you via DM on Instagram (colorful._.brits). Please share a bit about yourself, like where you're from and what you're hoping to find in a new feline friend. We truly believe that matching our kittens with the right families is essential for the happiness and well-being of everyone involved.</p>
                <p class="contact-item-3">We take great pride in raising our kittens in a warm and nurturing environment, and we want to make sure they continue to receive the same level of care and love in their new homes. That's why we kindly request that you share some details about your living situation, your lifestyle, and if you have any other furry companions at home.</p> 
                <p class="contact-item-4"> Bringing a kitten into your home means welcoming a loyal friend and companion for many years.
                    At this point, we want to emphasize how crucial it is to carefully consider if you are truly ready to bring a cat into your life. Please discuss this thoroughly with your family in advance, address any potential allergies, and be aware of the new responsibility. We are here to assist you with advice and support, but please remember that this is a decision for a lifetime.</p>
                <p class="contact-item-5"> Our kittens are ready for their new homes at 14 weeks* of age (*depending on your location). Prior to that, you are welcome to visit and get to know them starting from 8 weeks, after they have received their first vaccination.</p>
                <p class="contact-item-6"> Health: Our kittens leave us well-cared for:

                    They are double vaccinated against cat flu and feline enteritis (optional rabies vaccination).
                    They have been dewormed multiple times to ensure they are parasite-free.
                    They have undergone a thorough veterinary health examination.
                    They are microchipped for identification.
                    They come with their pedigree from Felidae Cat Club e.V. and a purchase/ care contract.
                    You will receive a care package with their familiar food for the first few days and other essentials.
                    Nutrition: Our kittens receive high-quality nutrition, with grain- and sugar-free wet food as well as fresh meat (BARF) to ensure a healthy diet.</p>
                <p class="contact-item-7"> Reservation: To secure a kitten, a reservation fee* is required as a deposit (*the fee is deducted from the purchase price but is non-refundable if you decide to cancel the purchase contract).</p>
                <p class="contact-item-8"> Socialization: Our kittens grow up in a family-friendly environment and become accustomed to everyday noises and visitors.</p>
                <p class="contact-item-9"> Please note: We do not place our kittens in homes with unsecured outdoor access and do not separate them as single cats.</p>
